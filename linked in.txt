Implemented an interactive online multiplayer game using HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, and WebSocket technology. The game features dynamic creation and joining functionalities, allowing users to either create a new game or join an existing one. Players are assigned unique colors upon joining, engaging in strategic gameplay by clicking on numbered balls to claim them with their designated color. Real-time updates and a notification system enhance the gaming experience, with the system determining the winner based on the first player to complete their colored set of balls. This project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack development, real-time communication, and creating engaging multiplayer experiences.
